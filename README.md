# Sandwich Club
### Project Overview
In this project, you will complete the Sandwich Club app to show the details of each sandwich once it is selected.

### Why this Project
Building a layout and populating its fields from data received as JSON is a common task for Android Developers. Although JSON parsing is usually done using libraries, writing the JSON parsing for this project will help you to better understand how it is processed.

### What will I learn?
Through this project, you will:
- [x] Learn how to submit projects for review
- [x] Practice JSON parsing to a model object
- [x] Design an activity layout
- [x] Populate all fields in the layout accordingly

### How Do I Complete this Project?
Design the layout for the detail activity so the different elements display in a sensible way. Implement the JSON parsing in `JsonUtils` so it produces a Sandwich Object that cab be used ti populate the UI that you designed.

### Submission and Evaluation
**Project Submission**   
In this project, you will add core functionality to the Sandwich Club app. You will build the UI and populate it with the data parsed from JSON.

**Evaluation**   
Your project will be evaluated by a Udacity Code Reviewer according to [this rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/1348/view). Be sure to review it thoroughly before you submit. All criteria must "meet specifications" in order to pass.

Each Android ND project will be reviewed against the [Common Project Requirements](http://udacity.github.io/android-nanodegree-guidelines/core.html), in addition to its project-specific rubric.
